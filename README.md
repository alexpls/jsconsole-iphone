# JS Console

A JavaScript web console, useful for quick experimentation, debugging, presentations (for live coding) and workshops.

This is the native version of [http://jsconsole.com](JS Console) - please do donate via the pledgie above - I doubt if this will ever make the iTunes store (I got bored of waiting).

# Features

- Resizable font (yep, biggest issue with Firebug in workshops)
- Autocomplete in WebKit desktop browsers
- shift + up/down for bigger console
- Save history (based on session)
- Add support for loading in a DOM (YQL - I thank you again)
- Permalink to individual executions

# Note

This version of jsconsole uses copied files from [http://github.com/remy/jsconsole](http://github.com/remy/jsconsole) - but a subset, not *all* the files. Therefore the files are (for now) manually synced.

# TODO

- Permalink to session (trickier, server side required - can I do it without?)
