 Hey there fellow JavaScript lover - I assume you've got a soft spot
 for the JavaScript, otherwise what use would a console be to you?
 
 This was primarily built out of a demo I wrote for my upcoming book
 introducinghtml5.com as a way to introspect what was going on inside
 a web worker, since the environment is sandboxed. Then I realised, 
 I need a sandbox environment/console that I could increase the font
 size - and having seen something similar-ish by @thomasfuchs, I went
 about tweaking my worker demo to this. About 3 hours work one late
 Sunday afternoon.
 
 The way this works, is I generate an iframe on the fly, an run the
 commands through an eval *inside* the iframe, so it's a fairly good
 enviroment to run tests. Then I've got a custom stringify function
 because JSON.stringify doesn't decode native DOM objects, like the
 DOMWindow object. 
 
 There's more I want to do with this, so watch the github account
 or even contribute: http://github.com/remy/console
 
 Otherwise, hope you enjoy this app. Any questions or issues, drop
 me a message on github or Twitter: twitter.com/rem
 
 - Cheers, @rem
